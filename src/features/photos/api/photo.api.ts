 * Straight to storage, with `fetch` rather than axios or the shared client.
 *
 * Not the shared client, because the signed URL carries its own scoped token
 * and sending Foodio's bearer token to a storage host would leak it. Not axios
 * either: React Native's `Blob` is a polyfill over a native handle, axios does
 * not recognise it as a body it can send, and quietly `JSON.stringify`s it — so
 * the "photograph" that arrives is 141 bytes reading
 * `{"_data":{"blobId":…}}`. React Native's own `fetch` passes a Blob straight
 * to XHR, which knows what to do with it.
 *
 * That failure is silent end to end: the PUT returns 200, the record saves, and
 * only the picture is wrong. It was caught by uploading a real photograph and
 * looking at the file on disk.
